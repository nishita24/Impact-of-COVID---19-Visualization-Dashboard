# Impact-of-COVID-19-Visualization-Dashboard
<br>
Since the common people are already suffering due to a wide demand-supply gap in the food which is majorly because of pandemic, corruption of middlemen, crops getting spoilt etc. so it's high time to make the best use of already accessible food items.
Our aim is to create a system which acts as a medium between the consumers and suppliers. This system will work on a machine learning model where the consumers will be able to see the availability of food material in their areas and also help them to stock the necessary food items accordingly. <br>
